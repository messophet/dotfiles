pigoz's dotfiles
================

These are my dotfiles. They are hosted here so it's easy for me to setup
new machines and keep them synchronized.

They aren't made to be used by other people (for example the gitconfig
has my name and email hardcoded), but I hope they are at least useful as
reference.

The `Rakefile` is based on [ryanb dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles),
with some changes. Some stuff is taken from
[garybernhardt](https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles) because it's awesome!
